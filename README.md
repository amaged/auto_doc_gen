"Bash is the gateway drug to automation" ~JR Rivers.


Why was this created:
====================
    
"Quickly" generate a formatted "baseline" output of all operation commands, A Cumulus Customer asked the Consulting for a troubleshooting guide and this would help them get started.

Other reasons:
=============

    Because creating and maintaining accurate and updated documentation is a full-time job. That’s why most people simply lack the documentation they need for troubleshooting, regulatory compliance, and change management. This dirty rudimentary script can make the start of this difficult task easier, by automatically creating a baseline document leveraging live network data.

0. Description

    A Script written in PHP to generate Documentation from a Production or Lab Network, it takes ~440 troubleshooting commands as input and generates HTML and Markdown pages as output, the output is divided into tables, each one with a different technology area (EVPN, BGP, SNMP...etc), each table has three columns, one for the command, another for the output and the third for the help section. 

    __________________________________________________________________


1. Prerequisites

    A) PHP is used to generate the output, so #!/usr/bin/php needs to be there.
    B) Edit the script 'make.parse.do' to include the host IP, example : $cumulusip = "35.193.138.248"
    C) Edit the script 'make.parse.do' to include the host username, example : $cumulususrname = "cumulus"
    D) Password will be prompted for the user to enter on the console
    E) The password will be prompted three times, so the user needs to manually do that.
    F) The list of commands should be in a file with the file name "initial.commands"
    G) Each section of commands has a heading to mark the section beginning, one pound (#) identifies a heading. (Example of a file is provided)

     __________________________________________________________________

2. How to run

   A) Extract the files on your personal laptop.
   B) Chmod of the script to be an executable with the command : $ chmod +x make.do.parse
   C) Make sure all variables are provided, including IP address of the destination host.
   D) Execute the script : $ ./make.do.parse
   E) Waiting time is variable, it depends on the length of the list of commands and if something went wrong
   F) Monitor the script performance by logging in to the network host where the host IP was provided earlier and run this command from the home directory of the user : "while true; do echo -ne $(cat current.command)"        \\r" && sleep 1; done"
   G) Install Doxygen
   H) Modify the Doxygen setting file 'Doxyfile' as needed and use it.
   I) Run Doxygen from the same directory as Doxyfile and all the Markdown Files

     __________________________________________________________________

4. Result

   A) After the script is done, it will require one last prompt for the ssh password on the prompt where the script was run.
   B) The script will generate many markdown files, and then Doxygen can be used later to consume them.

7. How it looks when running

    Cumulus-AT1176:script.201807191219 ahmed$ ./make.do.parse 
    Password: CumulusLinux!
    To watch progress, in new terminal:
    ssh cumulus@35.193.138.248
    while true; do echo -ne $(cat current.command)"        \\r" && sleep 1; done

    Slow lines:
       sudo cl-support
       sudo cl-support -s
       sudo vtysh (REALLY SLOW)

    Read nitial.commands.
    Generated rocessed.commands.
    cumulus@35.193.138.248's password: (Enter password once, copy from above)
    cumulus@35.193.138.248's password: (Do it again)
    cumulus@35.193.138.248's password: (One last time)
    Generated out.html.
    Generated out.md.
    Cumulus-AT1176:script.201807191219 ahmed$ 

    Here is how the monitoring window will look like while running and when its done:

    cumulus@oob-mgmt-server:~$ while true; do echo -ne $(cat current.command)"        \\r" && sleep 1; done
    438 nohup cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01control_plane_bgp.rules -h        -id|self-originated] -h          
    64 sudo nohup ps -ef        es -h            trol_plane_bgp.rules -h        
    438 nohup cat /etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/01control_plane_bgp.rules -h        02.0.0.2 --help                    

8. Doxygen needs to be install and all that is needed is just to run it in the same directory as all the MD files and the Doxyfile so it would generate the output directory.
